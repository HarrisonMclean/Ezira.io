# Ezira.io

Abstract:
A DPOS Blockchain based Social Network and marketplace, with a built in peer to peer filesharing and hosting network, multi tiered cryptocurrency, and smartcoins. Posts and Marketplace offers can be injected with promotion cryptocurrency to increase its rating, which is distrbuted as profit back to the network. 

Posts can be sorted by user controlled and fine tuned user created formulas. Users can sort by a customisable rating algorithm that allows users to control post weighting varible values from 0% to 100% (or -100% for reverse ordering). Popular voting presets could be implemented by default, or shared by users. Options to change the post weighting algorithm over time. For example, as the user scrolls down the page and the percentage of already seen posts increases over time, the algorithm shifts to make the post weighting more focused towards recency, to get newer posts. 

Users can make profiles containing any identity information they wish, and link in all of their other soial media accounts to crosspost to Ezira. Users can make pseudonyms for posting without association with thier regular identity. Users can also post anonymously. These 3 account types can be easily switched between for posting with as much or as little reputational association as is desired.
